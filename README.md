# Run-apache-server

My First EC2 Project on AWS – From Terminal to Live Website! 💻🌐

Just achieved a major milestone in my cloud journey:

1️⃣ Connected to my AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance using SSH keys via Linux terminal – no passwords, just pure key-based security. 🔐
2️⃣ Performed system update and upgrade to keep everything secure and smooth. 🔄
3️⃣ Installed and configured Apache2 web server – my EC2 was now hosting HTTP traffic! 🌍
4️⃣ Deployed a live website on Apache2 – seeing it work from a public IP was amazing! 🎉
